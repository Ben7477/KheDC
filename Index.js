    "Hi Khe!, I made this website or document for you since ayaw mo naman ng chats and para di mo nato mabura or ewan pero kung ayaw mo naman ng ganito is pwede moko ichat and idedelete ko to lahat. But anyways I want to greet you a happy birthday, this might be the worst or not the weirdest gift you might recieve this day since wala narin akong sapat na budget or 'di na umabot yung pera ko specifically para sayo or para sa bday mo and so I kind'a felt sad 'di'ko manlang kaya kang bigyan ng kahit simpleng regalo pero okay narin kasi alam kong 'di mo naman yung kakailanganin or like parang 'di mo naman na ako mamimiss or some sort so yeah. Anyways I sent this link to you to serve as a gift and siguro to let you know that I'm still waiting and will wait. I don't know how to be sweet enough but I tried and I'm still trying. To all those gifts I gave there's always a little thought na for sure 'di mo yun magugustuhan but I just want to make sure na 'di nasayang yung oras mo and 'di kana mag expect ng sobra sobra, but behind all those gifts I don't need or expected something in return maliban sa konting attention and time mo. The purpose of those gifts is to make you feel loved, make you feel secured and para 'di kanarin mag overthink which is 'di mo naman talaga need pero just in case atleast ready. I fr wanna make it up to you, treat you so good and like give you everything you want and what you deserve, so realizing that I can't and I really can't like It's something wrong with me na need ko ayusin to do so. Gusto ko lang din sabihin na "
